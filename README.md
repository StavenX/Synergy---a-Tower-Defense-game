# _Synergy_: A Tower Defense Game

Hello!

Welcome to a project made by us; a few students attending the University of
Agder's IT & IS program. We made this project for one of the courses which is
called "IS-213 Opensource". Our goal with this project is to see how it works
when you try to make a game in an Opensource environment.

## What is this about and why are we making it?

This game we are trying to make is a tower defense game. A game about building
structures to protect a goal and defeat attacking enemies as they traverse a
path toward the goal. We are trying to make this game as simple as possible
since this is our group's first time making a game together. Although at the
same time eventually we want to add new features and improve upon the "TD
formula". We think the experience we gain from doing this project can be
valuable to us in the future and at the same time be fun to make.

## How can you contribute?

The idea with this project is to make it accessible to anyone who wants to
participate hence why we made it in the opensource course of our study program.

All types of contribution are welcome. Our group is mostly concentrated on the
code aspect of the project. We do not have a specific plan on how the game
should be developed or how it should look at the end stages of the development
process so input on these aspects are also appreciated. 
Anyone is welcome as long as you behave and respect that we are new to this development format.
